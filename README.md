# FrontEndMentor-First-Project.

FrontEnd Mentor is a website where front-end developers get a design and are asked to make it into a page to practice their skills. This repository is my approach for the making of the first project on this page. I do not own this design or idea. If you want to try out the website you can do it here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

You can see the code of conduct, the license, and more on this project inside the **/about** directory. 

**If you want to see the original design you can do it here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj**
